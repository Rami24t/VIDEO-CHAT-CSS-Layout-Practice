##### Take a few moments to look at the live version [here](https://digitalcareerinstitute.github.io/UIB-layout-zoom-session/)

### Instructions

> - You will need to use Flexbox, CSS Grid and the `position` property
> - The images are included in the `assets` directory
> - The icons are from **Font Awesome**
> - The top and bottom sections of the page should be `fixed` in their respective locations to allow all nine image thumbnails to scroll
> - The page uses the _Gill Sans_ font
> - As always, **pixel perfect** :)
